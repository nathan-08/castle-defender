UPGRADING FROM OLDER VERSIONS:

If you have any fonts from v1.x of the pack installed on your systems, I
*strongly recommend* removing all older "Bm" and "Px" fonts before you install
any from v2.0. Quite a few fonts have been renamed or have changed roles, so
keeping the older versions will leave you with duplicates and with an
inconsistent set.
